1. SCSS folder
- all the scss goes into css folder
- here we have a config file where we can change 
the colors, show images, opacity

2. dist folder
- basically what you deploy to your host 
- we have the compiled css file, html, js, images

3. installment
- the compile tool we are using for sass is called node sass so we need npm to install it 

4. scss workflow
- main sass file any other files will be partials that import into this file 
- we need a way for sass to get compiled down to regular css
    - we use node-sass in this case 
- npm init to initialize package.json 
- set node sass up by npm scripts: npm run sass
- goto main sass file write some sass
- once save, it will update on css file
- do not touch the main.css file. only work in scss 

5. index.html
- only include the main.css 

6. scss
- add box sizing property
    - if padding on anything, it is not affect height and width
